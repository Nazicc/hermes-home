## Purpose

SDD prevents costly rework by enforcing a structured artifact pipeline — proposal, specs, design, tasks, implement, verify — **before** any code is written. It transforms vague requirements into testable acceptance criteria, catches design gaps early, and produces a reusable specification archive that outlives any single implementation session.

---

## Core Philosophy

fluid not rigid → iterative not waterfall → easy not complex →
built for brownfield not just greenfield → scalable from personal projects to enterprises

Every non-trivial change goes through a structured artifact pipeline before any code is written.

---

## When to Use SDD

**Appropriate when:**
- No specification exists yet for the feature or change
- Requirements are unclear, ambiguous, or only exist as vague ideas
- Multiple stakeholders have conflicting expectations
- The technical approach is not obvious
- Significant architectural decisions need to be made
- You want to prevent rework by aligning on scope first

**NOT appropriate when:**
- Requirements are already clear and stable
- The change is a well-defined bugfix
- You need to move fast and the cost of misalignment is low
- The task is trivial (one-liner, obvious rename, etc.)
- Exploratory prototyping (use iterative approaches instead)
- Hotfixes under time pressure
- Incremental bugfixes with existing test coverage

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Shifts Cost Left

Finding a design flaw in a spec costs 10 minutes. Finding it in code costs hours. Finding it in production costs days. SDD catches the expensive problems at the cheapest possible moment.

### 2. Creates Shared Understanding

Code is an implementation, not a specification. Without a spec, every reader must reverse-engineer intent from implementation details. With a spec, intent is explicit — the "why" and "what" are decoupled from the "how."

### 3. Enforces Traceability

Each acceptance criterion in a spec maps to a task, which maps to a test, which maps to a verification step. When a requirement changes, you trace the chain and know exactly what must be updated.

### 4. Produces a Living Archive

Specs survive team changes, context loss, and repository archaeology. A year later, the `SPEC/` directory tells you *why* a decision was made — not just *what* was built.

---

## Artifact Pipeline

IDEA → PROPOSAL → SPECS → DESIGN → TASKS → IMPLEMENT → REGRESSION → VERIFY → LAUNCH

Each artifact has explicit dependencies — later artifacts cannot be created before earlier ones are complete.

## Phase 1: Proposal

**File**: `SPEC/proposal.md`

Answer the "why" before the "what":

```
# Proposal: <short title>

## Problem Statement
What problem does this solve? Why does it matter now?

## Success Criteria
How do we know this succeeded? (measurable outcomes)

## Scope
What is in scope? What is explicitly out of scope?

## Constraints
What are the boundaries? Budget, time, tech stack, SLAs.

## Risks
What could go wrong? What are the unknowns?

## Alternatives Considered
What else was considered? Why was this approach chosen?

## Rollback Plan
How do we undo this if it goes wrong?

## Stakeholders
Who cares about this? Who approves?
```

**Do Not Proceed to Specs Without:**
- [ ] Problem statement that a reasonable engineer would call "specific"
- [ ] At least one concrete success criterion
- [ ] Risks identified (even if mitigation is TBD)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

---

## Phase 2: Specifications

**File**: `SPEC/specs/<feature-name>.md` (one file per logical feature)

Answer: **What exactly will we build?**

```
# Spec: <feature name>

## Overview
One-paragraph summary of what this feature does.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: <requirement title>
**Given** [precondition]
**When** [action]
**Then** [observable outcome]

### FR-2: ...

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: ...
- Security: ...
- Compatibility: ...

## Data Structures

### Type: [Name]
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Yes | Primary key |

## Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Invalid input | Return 400 with details |

## Edge Cases
- EC-1: <case> → <behavior>
- EC-2: ...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

**Rule**: Specs must be concrete and verifiable. "The system should be fast" is not a spec. "Response time < 200ms at P99 under 1000 RPS" is.

**Do Not Proceed to Design Without:**
- [ ] Every core feature has a Gherkin-style acceptance criterion
- [ ] Error conditions enumerated
- [ ] Data structures defined with field-level precision
- [ ] Edge cases explicitly listed

---

## Phase 3: Technical Design

**File**: `SPEC/design.md`

Answer: **How will we build it?**

```
# Design: <title>

## Architecture
[Diagrams, ASCII art, or text description of the architecture]

## Component: [Name]

### Responsibility
What this component owns and does.

### Public API

#### `method_name(params) -> ReturnType`
**File:** `src/path/to/file.py`
**Description:** [1 sentence]

## Data Flow
[How data moves through the system]

## Dependencies
- External: [list]
- Internal: [list]
- Configuration: [list]

## Security Considerations
- Input validation
- Auth/authz
- Data handling
- Secrets management

## Cross-Platform Concerns
- macOS / Linux / Windows differences
- Browser compatibility (if applicable)

## Migration / Backward Compatibility
How does this change affect existing users? Is migration required?
```

**Rule**: Design must specify the "how" with enough detail that a developer could implement it without asking further questions. "Use a cache" is not a design. "Use an in-memory LRU cache with 1000-entry limit and TTL of 5 minutes, evicted on process restart" is.

**Do Not Proceed to Tasks Without:**
- [ ] Architecture clearly described
- [ ] Every component has a defined responsibility
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Complex logic has code examples or detailed descriptions

---

## Phase 4: Implementation Tasks

**File**: `SPEC/tasks.md`

Answer: **Exactly what do we do, in what order?**

```
# Tasks: <title>

## Task Ordering Principles
1. **Foundation first**: Infrastructure, types, interfaces before implementations
2. **Dependency order**: If B depends on A, A is Task 1
3. **Thin slices**: Each task should be independently testable

## Task Checklist

### Task 1: [Short Title]
**Spec Reference:** `SPEC/specs/00X-feature.md`
**Design Reference:** `SPEC/design.md#component-name`

#### Steps
1. [`path/to/file.ext`]
   [exact code or diff]
2. [Verify] `command to verify`

#### Verification
- [ ] Command X passes
- [ ] Output contains Y
```

**Rule**: Tasks must be small enough to complete in a single session (< 2 hours). If a task is larger, break it down.

**Do Not Proceed to Implementation Without:**
- [ ] Every spec item mapped to a task
- [ ] Task ordering respects dependencies
- [ ] Each task has a verification command

---

## Phase 5: Implementation

### Per-Task Discipline

1. **Read** the task. Only the task.
2. **Verify preconditions** (does the file exist? is the dependency done?)
3. **Implement** exactly what the task says
4. **Verify** with the command in the task
5. **Commit** after each successful task

### Code Rules

- Zero tolerance for TODO comments in code — either do it or file an issue
- No commented-out dead code — delete it
- All new code must pass linting before commit
- Type signatures must be explicit (no `any` without documentation)

### Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[TASK-N] Short description
- What changed
- Why it was necessary
- How it was verified
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`

**Do Not Skip:**
- [ ] Running the verification command for each task
- [ ] Committing after each successful task

---

## Phase 6: Regression Tests

**Before marking any feature complete**, run the full regression test suite.

**Definition**: A regression test is any test that verifies existing, unchanged functionality still works.

```
# Regression Test Checklist

## Smoke Tests
- [ ] Core build succeeds: `make build` / `pnpm build` / etc.
- [ ] All unit tests pass: `make test` / `pnpm test` / etc.
- [ ] No new lint errors introduced

## Integration Tests (if applicable)
- [ ] API contracts still honored
- [ ] Database migrations run cleanly
- [ ] Auth flows unchanged

## Feature-Specific Regression
- [ ] Existing users can still do X (from previous specs)
- [ ] No performance regression on key paths

## Manual Verification (if no automated test exists)
- [ ] Feature X manually tested on [platform]
- [ ] Edge case Y manually verified
```

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

**Rule**: If the regression test suite has ANY failures after your change, you cannot proceed to launch until they are fixed or explicitly waived with a documented reason.

---

## Phase 7: Verification

**File**: `SPEC/verify.md`

**Before launch**, perform a final verification sweep:

```
# Launch Verification Checklist

```

---

## Phase 8: Launch

**Pre-launch:**
1. Final verification checklist complete
2. Regression tests green
3. Code review approved
4. Changelog updated
5. Version bumped (if applicable)

**Launch execution:**
```bash
# Verify everything is clean
make test && make build && echo "Ready to deploy"

# For infrastructure changes — dry run first
terraform plan -out=plan.tfplan

# Deploy with rollback capability
./scripts/deploy.sh --rollback-on-failure
```

**Post-launch:**
- Monitor error rates for 30 minutes
- Verify success criteria from proposal are being met
- Update proposal with actual outcomes

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding User Profile Feature (Good SDD)

**Scenario**: A microservice needs a user-profile endpoint.

**Without SDD**: Developer starts coding `GET /profile` directly. Halfway through, discovers they need auth middleware, database schema, rate limiting, and a migration plan. The endpoint works after 3 days but has no error handling for edge cases, no rollback plan, and the team discovers during code review that the API shape doesn't match frontend expectations — 2 more days of rework.

**With SDD** (30 minutes of spec + 4 hours implementation):

1. **Proposal** (`SPEC/proposal.md`): 10 lines — problem ("users can't update their profile"), success criteria ("P95 latency < 100ms"), scope ("read + write, no avatar upload"), risks ("auth dependency").

2. **Spec** (`SPEC/specs/001-profile.md`): Gherkin-style — `Given authenticated user / When GET /profile / Then returns {name, email, avatar_url}`, edge cases for unauthenticated and deleted-user.

3. **Design** (`SPEC/design.md`): Middleware chain `auth → rate-limit → handler`, data flow diagram, field-level schema definition.

4. **Tasks** (`SPEC/tasks.md`): 5 tasks — (1) DB migration, (2) repository layer, (3) handler, (4) middleware, (5) integration tests.

5. **Implementation & Verification**: Each task verified independently. Regression suite passes in 3 minutes.

**Result**: Working endpoint in half the time. No rework. Spec can be reused for documentation.

### Example 2: Refactoring Auth Middleware (SDD with Brownfield)

**Scenario**: Existing auth middleware has deep coupling — logic is mixed across 5 files. Team wants to extract a clean middleware layer without breaking existing routes.

1. **Proposal**: "Auth middleware refactor — extract JWT verification to standalone middleware. Risk: all 47 existing routes depend on auth. Rollback: keep old middleware as fallback for 2 weeks."
2. **Spec**: Each route group listed with its current auth behavior and target behavior.
3. **Design**: `AuthMiddleware` class, interface contract, test harness that compares old vs new behavior for each route group.
4. **Tasks**: One task per route group, each with before/after test comparison.
5. **Verification**: `diff --old-auth --new-auth` — all 47 routes produce identical responses.

**Key insight**: The spec caught that route group "/admin" uses a different JWT audience than "/api" — a design gap that would have caused a production outage if discovered mid-implementation.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Do NOT Do)

1. **Spec after code** — Writing the spec *after* writing the code defeats the purpose. The spec must exist before code.
2. **Vague acceptance criteria** — "Works correctly" is not acceptance criteria. Be measurable.
3. **Skipping regression tests** — "The change is small, it won't break anything" — it will.
4. **No rollback plan** — Every non-trivial change needs a rollback plan in the proposal.
5. **Implementing outside the spec** — If you found something the spec missed, update the spec first.
6. **Skipping design for "simple" changes** — Most bugs come from "simple" changes that weren't fully thought through.
7. **Spec as a one-time document** — A spec written and never consulted again is a waste of time. Refer to it during implementation, code review, and testing.
8. **Waterfall perfectionism** — The spec doesn't need to be perfect on the first draft. Iterate it as you learn, but lock design before implementation starts.

---

## When NOT to Use

- **Hotfixes under time pressure**: Deploying a hotfix takes priority over writing a spec. Fix, then spec the root cause.
- **One-liner changes**: Changing a CSS color, fixing a typo, updating a comment — no spec needed.
- **Exploratory prototyping**: Prototypes are for learning. Build one, learn, then spec the real implementation. Do NOT deploy prototypes as production code without spec.
- **Incremental bugfixes with test coverage**: If a test already describes expected behavior and the fix is local, implement directly.
- **Rapid hypothesis testing**: Changing one parameter in a config file to test a hypothesis — just change it and observe.
- **Trivial internal tooling**: A one-off CLI script only you will use once — no spec.

---

## Gate Criteria

Before moving to implementation, verify:

- [ ] Proposal clearly states the problem
- [ ] Each spec has at least one testable acceptance criterion
- [ ] Design identifies all files to be created/modified
- [ ] Tasks are in dependency order
- [ ] No spec contradicts another

---

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The idea is simple enough, we don't need a spec" | Simple ideas produce complex implementations without specs — the spec forces you to think it through |
| "I'll write the spec as I go" | This produces no spec. Specs require dedicated, uninterrupted thinking time before coding begins |
| "The user just wants a quick prototype" | Prototypes become production. Writing a spec for a prototype costs 30 minutes and saves days of refactoring |
| "I know what needs to be built" | Knowing and documenting are different activities. If it's not documented, it's not agreed upon |
| "We can fill in the details during implementation" | Implementation details reveal spec gaps — but finding them mid-implementation is 10x more expensive than before coding starts |
| "The existing codebase is the spec" | Code describes what the system does, not what it should do. Only a spec answers "should we change this?" |
| "Specs go out of date" | Unmaintained specs become wrong. Maintained specs are living documents — update them during implementation |
| "Writing specs slows us down" | Specs slow down bad implementations and accelerate good ones. The upfront cost is amortized across the entire project lifetime |
| "I'll remember all the edge cases" | You won't. The spec documents them so you don't have to hold them all in memory |
| "The code review will catch spec gaps" | Code reviews catch code quality issues. Spec gaps are found by QA, users, or production incidents — the most expensive places |
| "We don't have time to write a spec" | You don't have time NOT to write a spec. A 2-hour spec prevents 2-week refactors |
| "This is just a small change" | Small changes have an uncanny tendency to become large changes. Spec it before the scope expands |
